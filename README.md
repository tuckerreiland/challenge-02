# <Challenge 02>

## Description

This project was designed to practice the concepts of HTML and CSS that I've been practicing.  I built a personal portfolio using an HTML framework that incorporated internal and external linking as well as telephone and email contact features.  Once the framework was established I used CSS flexbox to layout the page, variables to assign colors, and a variety of classes and ids to achieve a functional and responsive mobile first application.  

## What I learned:

Over the course of this project I encountered several challenges, some of which I still haven't been able to resolve.  I had a difficult time getting the flexbox layout to behave how I wanted and felt as though the overall HTML and CSS structure could be more efficient.  Ultimately, I think that the HTML could have been structred in a slightly more efficient way to eliminate some of the issues I had later on with the flexbox.  As I was going through the CSS I found that positioning items on the page with flexbox became almost exponentially difficult as I tried to position elements within elements and maintain the aesthetic and functional qualities of the page.  The main takeaway was a better understanding of how flexbox does (or doesn't) behave and the importance of considering what positioning method makes the most sense even before any wireframe is erected or a line of HTML is written.

Another issue that I continue to have is seemingly disappearing images.  I'm not entirely sure why but images are not displaying for me when I test my code in browser.  The images do show up later when I deploy the site through github, however it's inconsistent at best.  I tried to find resources that applied to my specific issue and tried many things from direct and relative file paths to repositioning elements to insure nothing is hiding the images, but I couldn't find any solutions to the problem that worked.  I couldn't find a solution to the issue before the assignment was due, but I theorized it was an issue of image size and perhaps some kind of HTML or CSS feature that produces an error loading an image placed with HTML that's too large inside of a container that's too small.
