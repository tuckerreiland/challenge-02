# <Challenge 02>

## Description

This project was designed to practice the concepts of HTML and CSS that I've been practicing.  I built a personal portfolio using an HTML framework that incorporated internal and external linking as well as telephone and email contact features.  Once the framework was established I used CSS flexbox to layout the page, variables to assign colors, and a variety of classes and ids to achieve a functional and responsive mobile first application.  

## What I learned:

Over the course of this project I encountered several challenges, some of which I still haven't been able to resolve.  I had a difficult time getting the flexbox layout to behave how I wanted and felt as though the overall HTML and CSS structure could be more efficient.  Ultimately, I think that the HTML could have been structred in a slightly more efficient way to eliminate some of the issues I had later on with the flexbox.  As I was going through the CSS I found that positioning items on the page with flexbox became almost exponentially difficult as I tried to position elements within elements and maintain the aesthetic and functional qualities of the page.  The main takeaway was a better understanding of how flexbox does (or doesn't) behave and the importance of considering what positioning method makes the most sense even before any wireframe is erected or a line of HTML is written.
